<h4>Your friendly Neighborhood Fullstack Developer</h4>
<p>I am an AASI Level 3 certified snowboard instructor 
    looking to join Woodward Copperâ€™s team of summer
     snowboard coaches. I have taught guests of all 
     ages and ability levels over the eight seasons 
     that I have been coaching. Coaching park and 
     freestyle riding is one of my areas of expertise
      as a coach. Whenever there is a need for a park
       lesson, I am always the one who takes charge. </p>
